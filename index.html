            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
              <p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" target="_blank"><span class="link">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Ford</span></a> was born in 1863, Henry Ford was the first surviving son of William and Mary Ford, who owned a prosperous farm in Dearborn, Michigan. Growing up on a prosperous family farm, he was educated in a one-room school, where he showed an early interest in all things mechanical. This interest would develop into true genius and earn him the accolade of ‘one of the greatest industrialists in the world’.</p>

            <h3>Learning the trade</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Ford started young. By the age of 12, he was spending most of his spare time in a small machine shop, which he had equipped himself. It was here that he constructed his first steam engine, in 1878, aged just 15. The next year, Henry left home, bound for the nearby city of Detroit, to work as an apprentice machinist.</p>

            <h3>The evolution of mass production</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Ford designed his first moving assembly line in 1913, and revolutionised the manufacturing processes of his Ford Model T. 
            This assembly line, at the first Ford plant in Highland Park, Michigan, became the benchmark for mass production methods around the world.</p>

            <h3>Starting the Ford Motor Company</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Ford realised his dream of producing an automobile that was reasonably priced, reliable, and efficient with the introduction of the Model T in 1908. This vehicle signalled a new era in personal transport – it was easy to operate, maintain and handle on rough roads and was an immediate success.</p>

            <h3>A New Generation</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were advancing rapidly. 1919 saw Henry and his son, Edsel, acquire the interest of all minority stockholders for $105,568,858 and become the sole owners of the company. Edsel, who succeeded his father as President that year, continued to occupy the position up until his death in 1943, when Henry Ford returned to the driving seat of the company.</p>

            <h3>The end of an era</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Ford died at his home, in Fairlane in Dearborn, on 7 April 1947, at 11.40pm. He was 83. At the time of his death, the local Rouge River had flooded causing a local power cut. With kerosene lamps and candles lit, the scene must have been more reminiscent of his birth 83 years earlier.</p>

            <h3>The Ford trademark</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ford oval trademark is one of the best-known corporate symbols in the world and has been in regular use for more than 50 years. The script trademark dates back to the very beginning of the company when Henry Ford’s engineering assistant developed a stylised version of the words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a></p>
